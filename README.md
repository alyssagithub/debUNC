# debUNC (debunk Unified Naming Convention)
like sUNC and UNC but better (sens if u see this look out ur window)
reasons why i made this:
1. sUNC is obfuscated, sure u can ask the developers for the source code in order to debug but that's just a unnecessary step
2. sUNC's tests fail even though the function works, which atp what is the test even for?
3. sUNC and UNC don't test ALL of the functions many scripts use, only the most necessary, which makes it so even with a 100% score it's not supporting every script's function use
4. sUNC and UNC don't display the executor's version in test results, making it easy for people to misinform with outdated results
5. sUNC and UNC aren't made by me (i want to be famous)
# Loadstring
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://github.com/alyssagithub/debUNC/raw/main/debUNC.luau"))()
